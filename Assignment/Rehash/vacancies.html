                <h3>Head Receiver</h3>
                <p>
                    A new and important job role,
                </p>
                <p>
                    As head reciever you should take pleasure in things done to completion. 
                    This could be the climax of your career! You will be in charge of a lot of receiving in this position, 
                    how much recieving will vary day to day and will be decided by your own endurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Salary: We believe this job is very rewarding and will pay for itself ;)

                <h3>Senior Erection Manager</h3>
                <p>
                    A tougher role to endure. Many of our older clients in the construction industry have trouble with getting the blood pumping,
                    especially with younger team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will be your job to get into bed with these clients and softly encourage them to adopt newer techniques,
                    showing them how to engage with a younger and younger work force. This can be a very demanding job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Salary: We feel as though it would be an insult to offer money for such a rewarding job.
